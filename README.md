# PasswordManager

This is a simple password manager that I created with Java and MYSQL database. You can store passswords, create new passwords, replace passwords and find the passwords that you created. Passwords are created using secure random and a keyphrase that the user enters. Length of the password is at least 12 and can be customized by the user.
